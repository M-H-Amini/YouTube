## Who should watch?
Anyone who knows a little bit of Python.

##  Getting Started
1. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install autogen
   ```

2. Insert your OpenAI API key as `api.txt` file in the same directory as the script. The file should contain only the API key, without any additional text or formatting.

3. Run the `writing.py` script:
   ```bash
   python writing.py
   ```

4. Enjoy :)
