## Getting Started

1. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install arxiv
   pip install -U "autogen-agentchat"
   pip install "autogen-ext[openai]"

   ```

2. Insert your OpenAI API key as `api.txt` file in the same directory as the script. The file should contain only the API key, without any additional text or formatting.

3. Run the `agent.py` script:

   ```bash
   python agent.py
   ```
