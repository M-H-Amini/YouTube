## Overview

🚀 **Build an AI Agent for News Fact-Checking in Python (2025 Step by Step Tutorial)** 🚀

Ready to build your own AI Agent to put misinformation on notice? In this hands‑on guide, we’ll build an AI Agent that fact‑checks news headlines and statements in real time using Tavily’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) and AutoGen. I’ll walk you through every line of code—from spinning up a Tavily MCP server to verifying claims and shipping a slick Streamlit UI. No fluff, just actionable code you can copy, tweak, and deploy today! We'll **really** code...run into errors...and learn how to fix them together!

## Getting Started

1. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -U "autogen-agentchat"
   pip install "autogen-ext[openai]"
   pip install "autogen-ext[mcp]"
   ```

2. Insert your OpenAI API key as `api_openai.txt` file and your Tavily API key as `api_tavily.txt` in the same directory as the script. The file should contain only the API key, without any additional text or formatting.

3. Run the `app.py` script:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Enjoy :)
